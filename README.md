NOTE: This was my first project using Node.js. The coding style and methedologies in this program do not represent my current knowledge of Node.js. Further, this was a quick prototype, thus the project is not structured as a production-ready piece of software

# ArduinoGardenMonitor
Using a temperature and humidity module for the Arduino, the readings are polled and sent to a Node.js server which then verify's the data, then writes the data to a MySQL database. This was a quick weekend side project thrown together to learn more about Node.js
